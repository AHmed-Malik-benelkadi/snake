 **Snake** is a video game that originated during the late 1970s in arcades and has maintained popularity since then, becoming something of a classic. The player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. In other games, the end of the trail is in a moving position, so the snake continually gets shorter.
